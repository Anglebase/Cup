**Simplify and standardize C++ development.** Inspired by Rust's Cargo, Cup brings modern project management and dependency handling to the rich C++ ecosystem.

## Why Cup?

While C++ boasts a mature ecosystem, project setup and dependency management often involve complex, inconsistent workflows. Cup solves this by abstracting CMake complexities through:

1.  **CMake Abstraction**: Dynamically generates tailored CMake scripts based on standardized project structures
2.  **Minimal Configuration**: Define projects (name/type/dependencies) in simple config files â€“ no CMake expertise needed
3.  **Extensible Plugins**: Adapt to specialized build scenarios (e.g., Qt apps) via lightweight plugins

For most projects, built-in plugins suffice, while the extension system handles advanced use cases.

## Quick Start

### Installation

1.  Download the standalone `cup` binary from [Releases](https://github.com/Anglebase/Cup/releases)  
    **OR** run:  
    ```bash
    cup install @Anglebase/Cup && cup build -r
    ```
2.  Move the binary to your system path (e.g., `~/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin/`)
3.  Ensure the directory is in your `PATH`
