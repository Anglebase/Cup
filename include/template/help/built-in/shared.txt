R"(Shared Project Builder Plugin

Shared Project is a shared library project which has one shared library.

It's directory structure is like:
- ProjectRoot
    - src
    - include
    - export
        - <project-name>
    - tests
    - examples
    - cup.toml

The `src` directory contains the source files of the shared library.

The `include` directory contains the private header files of the shared library.

The `export` directory contains the public header files which as the interface of the shared library.
There is only one directory `<project-name>` in the `export` directory, which is the name of the shared library.

The `tests` directory contains the test files of the shared library.

The `examples` directory contains the example files of the shared library.

For `examples` and `tests` directory, it does not recursively search for the main files within it.
